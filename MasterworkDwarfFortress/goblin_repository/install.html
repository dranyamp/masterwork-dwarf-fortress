        <p>This mod is pre-installed. Just download, unpack, thats it. When you are reading this, you already installed the mod, congratulation. Please do not copy it over vanilla DF or older mod versions. Just unpack it into a new folder.</p>
        <p>To alter the mod, you can run the Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.exe. You will need to do this to set Warlocks as a playable race. Just open it up, click on 'Races' and you will see a large list of civilizations. Currently Dwarves, Orcs, Kobolds and Warlocks are potentially playable. Tick the box under 'Fort Mode' and all is done.</p>
        <p>If you just want to play one race, it is recommended to turn the other races non-playable. It will make embarking easier, since you dont have to chose your race ingame.</p>
<hr />
        <p align="center"><strong class="Rot">How to do a bug report</strong></p>
        <p>Sorry, had to add this. When you report bugs, please state the mod version and the tileset you use. If you run the mod on Mac or Linux, please state this as well. I need this kind of info, otherwise I cant search in the right places.</p>
<hr />
<p align="center"><strong class="Rot">Getting Started </strong></p>
        <p>Warlocks are very different from other civs. Your main resource will be corpses. To reanimate them, to make bones and blood, to get souls... each a ingredient for more, souls are a currency that you can trade with demons or use to power magic. Blood allows bloodwine, ink and summonings. Bones are used for armors and weapons, or to assemble more skeletons for your army. And corpses... corpses wont stay dead for long in this mod.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>The Embark</strong></p>
        <p>You chose a nice site, just as always. Bonus points for embarking on a tomb or necromancers tower, which will be friendly to you. Evil biomes are also good for you, since the undeads will protect you and your evil minions are immune to most evil weather.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>The Embark Preparation</strong></p>
        <p>Skills:</p>
        <p>Items: </p>
        <p>Pets: Warlocks dont do pets. You will be lucky if you find some evil animals like grave cats, barghests or brook trolls. Take them if you like, but mind that they will be attacked by undead beings, just like any other wildlife. Still good for early meat, bones and blood.</p>

        <p align="center"><strong>What then?</strong></p>
        <p>This is up to you. You can kidnap people, make ghouls and skeletons, train warlocks and summon demons. Dig for the HFS, survive the onslaught of the good races of the world, spread corruption and blight across the map. </p>
