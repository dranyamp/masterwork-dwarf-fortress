        <p>Gnomes LOVE machinery, and their ability to work with moving parts exceeds that of dwarves.  Gnomes can produce a series of special buildings that work as logical operators, allowing fast, efficient computing using axles and gear assemblies, as well as allowing direct interfacing between mechanical parts and gates, without the need for liquid or creature based computing.  Each logical operator can take input from any connected axle or power source, with the exception of gear assemblies.  The operator will then put the input values together and affect nearby gear assemblies and gates in a predetermined way.</p>
		<br>
		<p>There are 7 types of logical operators:</p>
		<p>NOT operators will return TRUE if they are connected to an unpowered input, and FALSE if they are connected to a powered input.</p>
		<p>AND operators will return TRUE if they are connected to at least one powered inputs without any unpowered inputs, and FALSE otherwise.</p>
		<p>OR operators will return TRUE as long as they are connected to at least one powered input, and FALSE otherwise.</p>
		<p>NAND will return TRUE as long as they are connected to at least one unpowered input, and FALSE otherwise</p>
		<p>NOR will return TRUE if they are connected to at least one unpowered input without any powered inputs, and FALSE otherwise.</p>
		<p>XOR requires both a powered input and an unpowered input to evaluate to TRUE, and will return FALSE otherwise.</p>
		<p>XNOR requires either all of its inputs to be powered or all of its inputs to be unpowered to evealuate to TRUE, and will return FALSE otherwise.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After evaluating its inputs, the operator will affect the following devices:</p>
		<br>
		<p>Gear assembly - TRUE: Engaged.  FALSE: Disengaged.</p>
		<p>Doors, grates, hatches, bars, and floodgates - TRUE: Open.  FALSE: Closed.</p>
		<p>Upright spikes - TRUE: Retracted.  FALSE: Extended.</p>
		<p>Bridge - TRUE: Retracted.  FALSE: Normal.</p>
