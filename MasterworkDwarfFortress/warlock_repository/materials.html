      <td width="665">Warlocks introduce only a few new materials. Ethereal (stone), Ethereal (metal), Empyrean (metal) and Dreadnought (metal). They do use some special materials that are known from Dwarf Mode, so I will make it short.
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Ironbone</strong> is an iron-grade metal from the Corrupted Forge. Its made of ash and bone.</p>
        <p><strong>Bloodsteel</strong> is a steel-grade metal from the Corrupted Forge. Its made of ironbone and blood.</p>
        <p><strong>Dreadnought</strong> is a metal slightly superior to steel, but heavier. It gives 50% extra damage reduction to units that wear armor made of it. Its made of bloodsteel and souls.</p>
        <p><strong>Color-Name Ethereal </strong>can be any color. Its a free block or furniture material from the Ethereal Gate that allows building rooms and walls quickly. </p>
        <p><strong>Ethereal metal</strong> is an iron-grade metal from the Ethereal Forge. It vaporizes after 3-4 months, but its free. You can summon unlimited equpiment that way, but you wont keep it for long.</p>
        <p><strong>Empyrean metal</strong> is a steel-grade metal from the Ethereal Forge. It vaporizes after 1 month, but its free. Again, its unlimited, but will disappear after a while.</p>
        <p><strong>Netherbark</strong> is a steel-grade, constantly cold leather. You get it from your Herbalist, made from nethercap logs. They only grow in the third cavern.        </p>
