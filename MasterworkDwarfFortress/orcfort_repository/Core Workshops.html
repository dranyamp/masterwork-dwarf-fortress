<title>Orc Fortress</title>
<body>

<h1>Core Workshops</h1>
<p>Orcs can use most all of the workshops from vanilla Dwarf Fortress.  For the
most part we won't go into too much detail as, there's not too much to say
about these 'shops: like most races, they cook and brew, hew blocks from stone,
and process cloth from plants. Orcs can use some of the workshops introduced in
Masterwork, including the Boneyard, Storage Unit, Fishpond, Slag Pit, and
Apothecary. The Boneyard and Storage Unit, in particular, are key fixtures in
an Orcish fort for processing the enemy and their belongings.A few Masterwork
shops, the Orcs can use in a limited capacity.  For example, Orcs can make
common alloys at the metallurgist, but they cannot  produce patternwelded
mithril bars or other fine dwarven alloys there. Orcs can use the Trap
Engineer, but not the advanced "2nd level" of upgrades. </p>

<p>Recently founded Orc clan holdings can't establish the Stonecutter, Rockforge,
Tailor, Poisoner, Gunsmith, or Sawmill, but see the entry on <em>The Goblin
Ghetto</em> to see how these industries are supported in larger Orcish villages. </p>

<p>Orcs lack access to uniquely Dwarven buildings like the Gemforge and
Glassforge, the Library system, Timberyard, advanced Forge and Furnaces, the
Armory and Weaponry, Runesmith, and Armok Religion buildings. </p>

<h2>Basic Industry</h2>

<h3>Orcish Tribal Craft Wargear</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/tribal_wargear.png"></p>

<p>This can be a very important workshop for an early settlement, especially if
elves or other dangerous ambushers are settled nearby and you need to get a
strong military online fast.  It lets Leather and Bone-workers create archaic
but deadly weapons and decent armor without any anvil or metal.  The inputs are
mostly organic materials that can be supplied by hunters (or warriors...) like
leather, shells, wood, ash, and bone.  The craftsman can even infuse the
weapons with blood in a dark ritual to make steel-quality weapons.   Therefore,
the Tribal Craftsorc should be grouped with the butchery, tannery, boneyard,
and crematory/ashery for best results.  Forts with a strong metal industry may
eventually phase out much of the work due to the complex recipes and limited
selection, but some tribal crafters continue to earn their keep by making
masks, cloaks, or decorative armor for export.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Lamellar leather:</em>  There are several options for ways to make lamellar leather by combining simple exotic leather with horn, wood, or shell.</li>
<li><em>Armor</em>:  The crafter can make armor sets, robes, cloaks, and masks from lamellar leather; this is about as good a protection as one can get from leather.</li>
<li><em>Handcrafted Weapons</em>:  The basic "ironbone" quality weapons are made from lamellar, ash, bone, and fuel.  Upgraded "bloodsteel" claws also require a barrel of blood but will punch through most armor.  Alternative recipe uses obsidian.</li>
<li><em>Armor decoration</em>:  Use gems, shell, and wood to apply batches of decoration to armor and helms.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Boneforge</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/boneforge.png"></p>

<p>The boneforge is where orcs can use ancient techniques to form
ironbone and bloodsteel. Ironebone is formed from one stack of bones
and two bars of ash. It can be transmuted into the stronger bloodsteel
with a barrel of blood and an additional bar of ash.</p>

<p>Logs can be reduced to ash at the boneforge, and blood extracted from
meat into barrels. Be warned that an entire stack of meat is required
for a barrel of blood.</p>

<h3>Orcish Fletcher</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/fletcher.png"></p>

<p>Many Orc clans rely heavily on archers to hunt, and to provide ranged support
for the warbands.  The Fletcher makes composite bows, requiring lamellar
leather as well as wood, or bone or iron.  These bows are twice as powerful as
the orcish recurve bow, that is, four times the primitive standard bow, so it
is worth upgrading when possible. The fletcher can also make batches of arrows
from lots of common materials, freeing up your forges for other work.</p>

<h3>Orcish Factory</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/factory.png"></p>

<p>The Factory is a multi-purpose building found in most permanent Orcish
settlements.  It can be used to make big batches of building material, perfect
for big building projects above ground.  It turns farmed trees directly into
charcoal while also collecting seeds -- note, Orcs don't use a Timberyard.
There are a few good options for batches of weapons, quite efficient use of
bars assuming you are using "Harder Smithing" setting, but not a great amount
of selection.</p>

<p>The Factory also allows mass production of cheap gear from inferior metals,
perfect for front line grunts or for weapon traps. Mass produced goods are
sufficient for Orcish Raid parties, too.</p>

<h3>Oricsh Molten Pit</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/molten_pit.png">
<img src="screenshots/magma_pit.png"></p>

<p>The Molten Pit is a versatile building with a couple different uses. First, it
is the Orcish mass production furnace.  The efficiency is a bit low, and some
of the material produced will be low quality rusty iron.  Rusty iron can be
used at the factory for rebar, barbed wire;  minted into coins to pay
Freelancers; or it can be cleaned up into regular useable iron at the
blacksmoke furnace. Orcs are comfortable working with low grade metals, and the
worker will automatically dispose of any waste slag and sometimes recycle small
quantities of usable product like flux, potash, or malachite.</p>

<p>The Molten Pit can also be used to reforge ill-fitting salvaged armor and
weapons from pitiful small enemies.   Re-forging allows you to very quickly
convert small gear made from good materials into usable armor. Note, however,
that the "cheap" recycled or factory pressed armor have some gaps and misfits,
so they only provide 80% coverage. Be careful to use stockpiles to control
which pieces the worker recycles, and be aware that if put on "repeat" he may
wastefully rework the same item over and over.  Simply scrapping the items will
provide a chance to recycle materials from the slag, but it will always be low
grade metals.  If you want to melt a piece down to recover high quality
material bars, you should use the normal smelter.</p>

<h3>Blacksmoke Furnace</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/blacksmoke_furnace.png"></p>

<p>The blacksmoke furnace is the is cornerstone of orcish heavy industry. It
allows the extraction of oil from oilbearing stones, or the conversion of four
bars of coke into oil. Acid can be distilled from flux, a vial, and a boulder
of either brimstone, saltpeter, or rock salt. Be warned that acid is so
corrosive it will render the vial unusuable after the vial of acid has been
used in a reaction.</p>

<p>Acid allows for the removal of rust from iron or steel, and oil is used in the
processing of rare minerals such as aluminum, chromium, cobalt, and titanium.
Batches of fire and acid arrows can be crafted with wood, iron and oil/acid
respectively. Foreign-made cannons can be upgraded to flamethrowers, and oil
and mechanisms can be combined in a box to create detonator or stickbomb
satchels, which the bravest of warriors can carry instead of a shield.
Finally, acid and oil can be combined to form synthsilk. While not as valuable
as the rare silks found in nature, it's perfectly serviceable for use in
threads and cloth.</p>

<p>All reactions at the blacksmoke furnace require fuel.</p>

<h3>Steamfoundry</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/steamfoundry.png"></p>

<p>The steamfoundry uses the skills of an advanced mechanic to improve existing
orcish materials and items. If orcs come into the possession of a prototype
golem, they can activate, equip, and repair it here.  Many reactions requite an
automaton gizmo, which are looted from automaton corpses. However resourceful
orcs can enchant these from an existing mechanism and a soul-gem (enchanted at
a totem pole).</p>

<p>The steamfoundry allows of the construction of synthshells (equivalent to
shellplate) by impregnating cloth with aluminium or titanium.  The steamforge
can upgrade scimitars, toothed axes, mauls, and flachette guns to more powerful
mechanised versions. These all require oil, automaton gizmos, and razorwire
(edged weapons), lead (mauls), or brass (flachette guns).</p>

<p>Finally, if orcs obtain a toolkit or dwarf tools, they can create powerful
landmines (toolkit) or upgraded axe and saw traps (dwarf tools).  Upgraded
traps also require pulleys, which can be raided from merchant shipping,
purchased at the arms bazaar, or crafted at the goblin tinkerer.</p>

<h3>Dasascene Workshop</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/damasc_forge.png">
<img src="screenshots/magma_damasc.png"></p>

<p>A warlord and his chosen war-orcs might get their weapons at a Orcish Damascene
Shop, where an artesian uses ancient methods to fold exquisite blades from rare
metals.  Unfortunately, the orcish damasc worker needs foreign tools salvaged
from human or dwarven loot to make the finest armors. The Damascene folder
requires rare ores such as mithril, cobalt, or wolfram; and tempers these
alloys with steel, copper, silver, or gold.  He uses powdered materials
directly to create unique alloys, and cannot create standard bars for use at
the forge.</p>

<h3>Arcane Forge</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/arcane_forge.png"></p>

<p>In a past age, there were great Orcish dark citadels stretching from the
surface to the deep roots of impenetrable mountains. Among these Deep-Orcs, the
greatest armies were lead not by brutish warlords, but fell sorcerer-kings and
powerful druids.  They wielded special Orichalcum alloy weapons that reinforced
their magical links to the chaotic magic of the spirit realm, or into the
eldritch power of the forests. Today the great Arcane Forges of the old
kingdoms have been lost; destroyed or captured by armies of the jealous Drow
striking from the underdark.</p>

<p>The warchief who has enough Orichalcum on hand to light a new Arcane Forge will
be able to equip his Dreamwalkers with enchanted weapons which give the wielder
access to powerful battle-magicks. If the wielder is willing to give up use of
a shield, he can also use an off-hand Dreamcatcher, an arcane focus enchanted
with a second supporting spell. The Arcane forge can also craft runic ammo to
be cast from magic weapons, although these must be taken to a Place of Power
(stone circle, etc.) to become enchanted with any special effects.</p>

<h2>Outlander Allies' Technology</h2>

<h3>Ashland Glassblower</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/ashland_glassblower.png"></p>

<p>The ashclan elves live a semi-nomadic lifestyle, with outposts 
scattered outside the primeval forests and off the major routes of trade. 
Without reliable access to steeloak or mithril ore, they have developed an 
alternative crafts tradition of glassblowing. They make expensive "ruby 
stained" glass from powdered gold, and fine "cobalt stained" glass from 
cobaltite. With access to moonstone and malachite, or obsidian, they can 
make weapons-quality metallic glasses that rival the mithril gear of their 
silvan cousins, including the sharp, lightweight green ashland glass and heavy 
ebonglass.</p>

<h3>Underdark Nethermill</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/nethermill.png"></p>

<p>Deep drow traditionally patrol the caverns of the underdark with wicked curved
blades and crossbows made from crystalwood, devilthorn warhammers, and curious
fire-resistant leather armor made from netherwood. Although their motives are
suspect, traders from the deep realms sometimes appear offering to share these
technologies with their allies.</p>

<h3>Rogue Tavern</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/rogue_tavern.png"></p>

<p>Human bandits are well known for the raucous pirate dens found in 
their harbor towns. Gamble for coin, with games available for every price 
point! Lose money in the long run, but maybe you'll get lucky. Or win the other 
guy's jewels, weapons, ship... or more if you play at the Shadowbroker's somnium 
table. Orcs can play some human- or dwarven-style instruments for musical 
effects, or thoroughly use up any type of instrument by playing Orcish jazz for 
tips.</p>

<h3>Legion Auxilla Outpost</h3>

<p><img src="legion_outpost.png"></p>

<p>Orcish warriors usually favor their slashing weapons, 
but those who have fought alongside (or against) the forces of the grim Dwarven 
Legion can attest to the efficient killing power of an army with a mixed 
arsenal. The auxilla outpost can craft deadly hammers and piercing spears, 
cast a variety of bolts and javelins, and combine these dwarf-style weapons into 
versatile mixed-arms kits which are deadly at both melee and ranged combat.</p>

<h2>Skill Training</h2>

<p><img src="screenshots/bloodbowl.png"></p>

<p>Orcs do not excel at abstract thought, and have not embraced the concept of
learning skills from books.  However, the orcs' enthusiasm for physical
contests and sports can take the place of serious training, to a degree.</p>

<h3>Blood Bowl / Gateball</h3>

<p>Orcs are passionate about any sport played with a ball on a field.  The few
recorded instances of peaceful interaction between Orcs and Humans involve
orcish speakers trading for the rules and equipment for soccer, rugby, lacross,
handball, gateball, croquet, and countless other games.  Of course, when they
get home, they pretty much play every sport the same way, and with very little
regard for the human version of the rules.  At a training pitch, Orcs can train
throwing, striking, dodging, coordination, or melee combat, and will use up on
average 1 piece of leather per 10 skill advances.</p>

<h3>Weight Set</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/weightset.png"></p>

<p>Orcs enjoy lifting weights, and even more so enjoy setting up stacks of weights
arbitrarily and striking them with weapons.  At this station orcs can train
weapon, armor, and shield skills.  They'll wear out about 1 piece of wood,
leather, or makeshift armor training equipment per 20 skill advances.</p>

<h3>Philosopher's Garden</h3>

<p>(not pictured)</p>

<p>Even the least intellectually curious Orcs can be convinced to partake in
activities such as: bellowing their thoughts at random to passersby, or
delivering rambling semi-dramatic soliloqies to the skulls of defeated enemy.
A savvy clan leader may be able to frame these activities in a way that
promotes learning.  At the philosophy podium Orcs can train a variety of mental
skills, and will use up totems, cloth, and paper supplies at a rate of about 1
piece per 20 skill advances.</p>

<h3>Anatomical Theatre</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/anatomical.png"></p>

<p>Orcish shamans typically have plenty of opportunity to practice their medical
skills on live targets, but in the rare quiet moment, they can practice
suturing, bonesetting, or wounddressing at the anatomical theatre.  They will
consume about 1 piece of thread, cloth, or splint per 10 skill advances.  Some
clan leaders will also send down enemy cadavers and vermin remains for
disposal, no questions asked, when the butchery and crematorium are overworked.</p>
