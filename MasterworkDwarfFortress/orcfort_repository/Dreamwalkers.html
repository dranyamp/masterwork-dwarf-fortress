<h1>Dreamwalkers</h1>
<p>About 5% of Taiga orcs are <strong>"Dreamwalkers"</strong>, weird frail creatures who are
nevertheless feared and honored for their mental prowess.  Dreamwalkers are
adept priests and doctors, and they can often read and write -- even using
numbers on occasion.  Female Dreamwalkers are revered among the dwindling
tribes for they often have litters of multiple young.  In many clans,
Dreamwalkers lead a quiet existance, working in professional roles that don't
suit other orcs, as Shaman, Speakers, or Scribes.  However, there are other
paths that Dreamwalkers can follow in more progressive... or more desparate...
clanholdings.  When called upon to join the warbands, Dreamwalkers seek out
special arcane weapons which channel dark aspects of their druidic magics, and
a few undertake spirit journeys in the hope of becoming powerful sorcerers.</p>

<h2>Dreamwalker Elite Castes</h2>

<p>SORCERERS focus on destructive spells effective at relatively close range, 
particularly those which cripple the enemy and make him vulnerable to 
counterattack. Their signature spells include the crippling Rite of Pain 
and the debilitating Decay. Some choose to enter the melee, using Bone 
Armor to boost their own toughness and the Witchknight's Sigil to make enemies 
vulnerable to orichalcum and bloodsteel weapons, delivering the killing blow 
with their heavy Wraithblade swords. Others prefer the dark power of 
necromancy, either raising corpses with the Barrowdraugr spell, or attempting to 
turn the living with wraithbinding shards. They reserve the Oblivion's 
Embrace as personal protection against the unpredictable dead. </p>

<p>DRUIDS use 
savage nature magic to support the warbands. They employ a variety of 
magics that slow or weaken enemies. They are also adept skirmishers, 
harassing foes with sticky mud, toxic clouds, or poisonous swarms. Some 
druids will employ the wild Polymorph magic which briefly changes an enemy into 
a wild beast, or the powerful Hibernate spell to force enemies into a deep 
slumber.</p>

<p>FROSTSKALDS use the powers of frost and storm to destroy opponents. 
They pelt enemies simultaneously with super-chilling freezing vapors, water, and 
ice, performing both physical and frostbite damage. They use a strange 
meditative state to stabilize their own internal body temperature, but their 
frost spells can be dangerous to other orcs after prolonged exposure. Many 
Frostskalds also add paralyzing lightning spells to their arsenal, and all 
greedily seek out the Chill Blood spell which renders enemies greatly vulnerable 
to their attacks.</p>

<p>ORACLES can fill a wide range of roles, from blinding 
enemies with Solar Flare to pelting them with a Meteor Storm. Some Oracles 
serve in a support role using Tarot and Warming Rays to boost the luck and 
recuperation of allies, while others embrace their destructive nature with Nova 
and Apocalypse spells. Strangest of all is their ability to forecast the 
doom of a single enemy with Prophesy, or to tie a foe's madness to the phase of 
the moon with Lunacy.</p>

<h2>Druidic Weapons</h2>

<p>In a past age, the greatest Orcish armies were lead not by brutish warlords,
but fell sorcerer-kings and powerful druids.  They wielded special weapons
that reinforced their magical links to the chaotic magic of the spirit realm,
or into the eldritch power of the ancient forests.  Today the great Arcane
Forges of the old kingdoms have been lost; destroyed or captured by armies of
the jealous Drow striking from the underdark. Further, the clans have no new
source of <em>orichalcum</em> alloy.  Most surviving stores of orichalcum have been
surrendered to practical-minded smiths and turned to mundane axes or mail, but
it's not impossible to swindle a bar now and again from an absent minded
trader.  Tales also tell of elven and drowen mystics using similar weapons --
perhaps soon enough the Freelancer's Guild will fulfill their promise to look
into these rumors.</p>

<p>The warchief who has enough Orichalcum on hand to light a new Arcane Forge will
be able to equip his Dreamwalkers with enchanted weapons which give the wielder
access to powerful battle-magicks. If the wielder is willing to give up use of
a shield, he can also use an off-hand Dreamcatcher, an arcane focus enchanted
with a second supporting spell. The Arcane forge can also craft runic ammo to
be cast from magic weapons, although these must be taken to a Place of Power
(stone circle, etc.) to become enchanted with any special
effects.</p>

<h2>Dreamwalker's Workshops</h2>

<p><img src="screenshots/totempole.png"></p>

<p>There are five magical workshops:  The first is the totem pole, which is
dedicated to simple rituals that any orc can perform.  At the totem pole, Orcs
can fortify their courage or pain resistance. The totem pole is also the
gathering point for Orcish musicians who use tambourines, didgeridoos, or
bagpipes to encourage their clansmates to acts of valor.</p>

<p>Importantly, the totem pole allows for the transmutation of bone, ash, and blood
into valuable ironbone and bloodsteel. These are viewed as more honourable
counterparts to common iron and steel, as they continue to bring honour to
those who have fallen in combat.</p>

<div class="adjacent_images">
<img src="screenshots/stone_circle.png">
<img src="screenshots/altar_storms.png">
<img src="screenshots/sun_orrery.png">
<img src="screenshots/icecrystal_sanctum.png">
</div>

<p>The other places of power include the Stone Circle, Altar of Storms, Icecrystal
Sanctum, and Sun &amp; Stars Orrery. With the exception of the Icecrystal Sanctum,
all of these places of power <em>must</em> be constructed outside. These places are
used mostly for Dreamwalkers to attempt Spirit Journeys to learn spells, once
the clan owns a copy of the proper dreamwalking codex. All reactions at the
Places of Power are governed by MAGIC_NATURE skill, so workshop profiles can be
used to lock out non-adepts.</p>

<p>Some reactions at places of power require a dreamwalker talisman; each talisman is
formed by weaving the soul of a fallen foe into material form by a dreamwalker
at a totem pole. This is an automatic reaction, but only greater souls can be
used for this purpose. The souls of animals and lesser foes are of no use to
dreamwalkers.</p>

<h2>Dreamwalkers' Spells</h2>

<p>There are four ways for dreamwalkers to use magic. </p>

<p>Dreamwalkers automatically learn a unique, powerful set of 
spells when they undertake a spirit journey and enter an advanced spellcasting 
society, or caste. This process requires a caste CODEX which can be 
crafted at great expense, or occasionally looted by raiders. The CODEX is 
preserved on use.</p>

<p>Any Dreamwalker including those who have joined an advanced caste can learn
single spells by using a MOJO at the right Place of power.  The spell is
learned permanently, but the MOJO is used up. MOJOS can be created at random
when Orcs perform sacred rituals at the places of power, or somewhat commonly
looted by raiders. Some enterprising clanleaders find it useful to trade for
spellbooks from foreign caravans, as well. It is whispered that some Drowen
researchers have mastered the arcane art of crafting specific "scrolls" --
their profane foreign word for MOJOs -- on demand. </p>

<p>Any Dreamwalker including those who have joined an advanced caste can
temporarily learn additional spells by wielding ENCHANTED WEAPONS, and by
carrying DREAMCATCHERS in their off hand. Enchanted gear is crafted at the
Arcane Forge.</p>

<p>ENCHANTED WEAPONS can also fire spells at range using special ammo. Bladed
magic weapons can interchangeable share any SHARD type ammo, while druidic and
mage type magic weapons can interchangeably share MAGICMISSLE type ammo. First
"blank" spell ammo is crafted at the arcane forge, or through rituals at the
place of power. These blanks can be fired at enemies to do mundane damage. Or,
they can instead be enchanted at the Places of Power with additional magical
effects. Note, rune-ammo magic is notoriously volatile even by Orcish standards
-- spells including Chainlightning, Nova, or Wraithbinding may not be
particularly safe to fire into a melee with friendly forces.</p>
