<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
<h3>Orc Physiology</h3>

<p>Uruks are about 50/% larger than snaga -- only these larger orcs can
effectively equip a great-axe or daikatana with a shield.  Snaga usually
have the agility to be deadly with bows, but lack the strength to use blunt
weapons with poor leverage (i.e., clubs).  Try to give your orcs equipment
that matches their skills (you'll never go too far wrong with scimitars,
jagged axes, and jagged spears).</p>

<h3>Economizing on Raiding Gear</h3>

<p>The Raiders Drydock is used not only to strike back at the
'Free' Peoples and grab some loot, but also to round up
goblins, steal codexes, and may trigger sieges against your camp.
It's risky business, but scalps and souls are the only way to
unlock the more powerful buildings and technologies in Orc Fortress.</p>

<p>To support the
Drydock you'll need a source of rusty iron coins, ballista parts,
plenty of wood, and also Weapons. Exchanging bounties at the
Freelancer's guild is usually the best source of coins, but you
might also mint coins from rusty iron bars you get from Molten Pit or
Goblin trading partners. If you are short on wood but have plenty
of cloth and pulleys, consider sail-powered Xebecs instead of regular
Longboats. If you don't have junk weapons laying around,
forge weapons with the smallest materials requirement like daggers, or
save on materials by batch production at the Orcish Factory.</p>

<h3>Above Ground Forts and Aquifer Forts</h3>

<p>Don't be afraid of aquifer embarks! Orcs have lots of tools 
available to make strong mostly- and even entirely-above ground forts, 
starting with the arms and armor from the Tribal Warcrafter and 
Fletcher, and Boneyard for mechanisms. Many of the orcish places of
power, along with the drydock, <em>must</em> be built above ground.</p>

<p>Trade for cheap raw materials from the Goblins civilization if they are active. Once 
you get your drydock and Raiding crews on line, you can raid the Elves for wood, the 
Dwarves for metal, or Merchants for precious metals and captives to 
expand your purchasing options.</p>

<h3>Ranchers and Hunters</h3>

<p>Orcs can do a lot with leather, bone, and blood at the Tribal Craftsorc 
and Fletcher, so you might want to get Ranchers or Hunters industry 
going early. Embarking with some birds or ranching animals is 
usually more efficient use of points than paying for leather or quivers 
directly.</p>

<h3>Organizing Tool Stockpiles</h3>

<p>There are lots of new items in Orc Fortress, and a lot of them are 
stockpiled as Tools. Use Materials setting in your stockpile to 
control which type of tools goes where. For example: elven 
enchanted toolkits should always be mithril, while warrior society 
codexes should always be steel.</p>

<h3>Harder Smithing setting &amp; Artisan Craft Efficiency</h3>

<p>Orc Fortress is balanced assuming the "Harder Smithing" setting is on.
Many of the custom reactions will cost a similar amout of material to
Harder Smithing, and some will have efficiency savings like the batch
processes at the factory.  If you play Normal Smithing, the tradeoffs
will be different, and in many cases you might be just better off with
more ordinary forges.</p>

<h3>Harder Farming setting &amp; Captives</h3>

<p>Your Raiders will sometimes bring back a "Dwarven (etc.) 
Captive". In an embark with shortages of materials like wood, 
stone, or cloth, the Labor Cell workshop can be invaluable, but careful 
because the laborers will go through food or drink pretty fast. If 
you bring them a big stack of food, they'll produce more output, but 
they'll still eat it all. If you play Harder Farming you'll 
need a large food production capacity to use captive labor with any 
regularity. You can also ransom 
the captives at the Shadowbroker for a random  large sum of coins and a 
commemorative statue, suitable for mounting in your trophy hall.</tr></p>

<h3>Vermin Hunting Options</h3>

<p>Orcs can use cats or frill lizards for vermin hunting. You also 
may have access to drowspiders or arctic condors. Arctic 
condors are trainable for regular hunting too.</tr></p>

<h3>Slag Pit setting vs. the Orcish Molten Pit</h3>

<p>Orc Fortress already had its own "slag" system that is 
different from the one implemented in Masterwork. When you use the 
Orcish Molten Pit to smelt batches of ore or destroy trash gear, you 
have a chance to produce low-value (but possibly useful) rusty iron, 
dolomite, malachite, or potash. If you really like slag you can 
turn on the Masterwork system too; the Orcs now have access to the 
Dwarf-style slag pit for processing "slag bars".</p>

<h3>Magma Engineering</h3>

<p>There is lots you can do with the Magma Source and you should 
experiment, but here is an idea of how to get started. * Build a 
rail line with one end near your source station and the other at the 
edge of the target: cistern, aquifer to be obsidianized, river to be dammed, etc. * 
Build a stop at both ends. the end by the cistern should auto-dump 
towards the cistern. * Create a tram route set to "push cart when 
greater than 50% full," note that using the "guide" setting can put 
workers in splash-danger. * Create a return condition "guide when empty" 
* Add a magmatanker to the route * Set magmasource to fill the tanker using manager.
Magma/water cisterns are filled by Orcs carrying the "magma filled 
bottle" item created at the Source station, and will release the fluid 
when deconstructed. You may want to rig a support cave in to do 
this remotely. Workshops seems to be able to fill it's own area plus 
about one ring around (assuming it has enough magma inside). So a 1 tile 
workshop can fill a 3x3 space, and a 3x3 shop can fill 5x5 space.</p>

<h3>Places of Power and Rare Gems</h3>

<p>Spellcrafting reactions require specific material like silver and 
gold for the druidic magic at the Stone Circle, and bloodsteel and iron 
for sorcerers magic at the Altar of Storms. You may want to 
consider the resources on hand if you are choosing one school of magic 
over the other. They also require small quantities of specific 
rare gems like emerald, sapphires, or clear diamonds. If you lack 
silver, gold, or rare gems, look to your Raiders to attack merchant 
shipping, or equip thieves at the Kobold Trackers hut.</p>
