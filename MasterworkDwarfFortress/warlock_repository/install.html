        <p>This mod is pre-installed. Just download, unpack, thats it. When you are reading this, you already installed the mod, congratulation. Please do not copy it over vanilla DF or older mod versions. Just unpack it into a new folder.</p>
        <p>To alter the mod, you can run the Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.exe. You will need to do this to set Warlocks as a playable race. Just open it up, click on 'Races' and you will see a large list of civilizations. Currently Dwarves, Orcs, Kobolds and Warlocks are potentially playable. Tick the box under 'Fort Mode' and all is done.</p>
        <p>If you just want to play one race, it is recommended to turn the other races non-playable. It will make embarking easier, since you dont have to chose your race ingame.</p>
<hr />
        <p align="center"><strong class="Rot">How to do a bug report</strong></p>
        <p>Sorry, had to add this. When you report bugs, please state the mod version and the tileset you use. If you run the mod on Mac or Linux, please state this as well. I need this kind of info, otherwise I cant search in the right places.</p>
<hr />
<p align="center"><strong class="Rot">Getting Started </strong></p>
        <p>Warlocks are very different from other civs. Your main resource will be corpses. To reanimate them, to make bones and blood, to get souls... each a ingredient for more, souls are a currency that you can trade with demons or use to power magic. Blood allows bloodwine, ink and summonings. Bones are used for armors and weapons, or to assemble more skeletons for your army. And corpses... corpses wont stay dead for long in this mod.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>The Embark</u></strong></p>
        <p>You chose a nice site, just as always. Bonus points for embarking on a tomb or necromancers tower, which will be friendly to you. Evil biomes are also good for you, since the undeads will protect you and your evil minions are immune to most evil weather. You might have a problem butchering corpses and getting souls/bones in evil biomes.</p>
        <p>The early game will be much easier than with dwarves, because your skeletons dont need anything, and wildlife is barely any danger to your minions at all.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>The Embark Preparation</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Skills</strong>: Warlocks can learn Researching, Writing, Praying, Gem Setting/Cutting, Herbalism, Alchemy and Chemistry. Ghouls and Skeletons learn no labor skills, so getting correct skill points is rather important. You can later teach skeletons skills in workshops. I would recommend to take a lot of miners, masons and woodcutters. Maybe a few combat skills as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Items</strong>: Some food and drinks for the Warlocks and Ghouls. Thats really all you need. Bonesaws and Picks can be made in the Boneforge early on, and getting bones is easy. You can buy large amounts of raw materials, or enough metalworking related items to start first thing on armor and weapons. </p>
        <p><strong>Pets</strong>: You usually cant buy pets. Sometimes you see some evil creatures in your list, take them if you want to. I wont go into detail here, since they can be any evil creature that exists in the world, it would be a long list. But fear not: Every Warlock will spawn 4 Mephits automatically. Tiny scaly monsters, each one associated with either air, fire, ice or acid. You can keep them as defense or butcher them for souls and bones.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>First things on the map</u></strong>        </p>
        <p><strong>Nobles</strong>: Your Steward is automatically elected. He appoints the other nobles. You can also make a Ghoul or Skeleton squad, using the Cryptlord or Ghoulmaster militia captians. Use them for hunting. Appointing a Keeper of Knowledge will net you a bookkeeper, broker and manager, but he requires some rooms and furniture.</p>
        <p><strong>Workshops</strong>: A mason, a carpenter, a craftsman. Butcher and Tanner. Next to them: The Soul Syphon, to preserve souls by using hourglasses. Once you have 3 full phylacteries (hourglass with soul), build a Ethereal Gate. It allows free furniture and blocks. Mind that you need to use the blocks quickly, they will disappear after a while. If you build a wall or floor with them, they will stay. </p>
        <p>With rooms done, you can start hunting wildlife and butchering the corpses to get more bones and souls. Build a Graveyard and use the meat to attract zombies or ghouls, and build a Necromantic Shrine as soon as you have the needed souls. You can build more skeletons and other minions there. </p>
        <p>Build an Inscriptor to raise the skill of your Skeletons. Use them for your crafting skills. A tailor can easily make leather armor for all, the boneforge makes bone armor set.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>Safety</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Wall-in(?)</strong>: Some sort of protective area for your Warlocks wouldnt be too bad, but overall is much better to allow your Ghoul and Skeletons squads to reach targets quickly. You need those souls.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><u>Advancing</u></strong>        </p>
        <p><strong>Pylons</strong>: You might have noticed that skeletons turn opposed-to-life now and then. If they run too far from your Warlocks, you cant control them. Build a network of Pylons at the Soul Syphon to establish control across the map. More info later in the manual.</p>
        <p><strong>Shredders</strong>: All Warlock-specific workshops need raw materials. In the beginning its souls and bones. But for higher tier things you need special reagents, made from strip mining the entire map. The shredders can turn plants, ores, woods and gems into these materials. Just chuck everything in.</p>
        <p><strong>Alchemy</strong>: The Alchemist is very important to advance. It takes the raw materials from the shredders and make ritual reagents from it, which are used to learn spells and do rituals in workshops.</p>
        <p><strong>Libraries</strong>: You need a lot of glue from bones/horn and paper/vellum from wood/leather to write books. It takes about 80 books to finish all the libraries, which gives your Warlocks something to do: Learning spells and writing special books. The spells make them better in combat, while the books unlock the best workshops you have.</p>
        <p><strong>Raiding</strong>: Your Overlord can command raids on targets that net you Prisoners, Goods or Scalps. Prisoners can further be searched, questioned and tortured for more information on better targets. Rinse, repeat, and make some profit.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u>What then?</u></strong></p>
        <p>This is up to you. You can build cagetraps and convert invaders in your Torture Chamber. Or use the High-Tier workshops to curse them with lycanthropie or turn them into thralls. The Darkpact allows deals with demons, or transform your fort into a vampire den, or make a maze full of animated weapons and armors. There is lots to discover.</p>
