<title>Orc Fortress</title>
<body>

<h1>Orcish Weapons</h1>
<h2>Forged Weapons</h2>

<p>There are lots of ways to get weapons in Orc Fortress, but having a good smith
work a forge will never be obsolete.  The standard selection of weapons is
somewhat different than in a Dwarven settlement. These same weapon types can be
made at the Factory too, in efficient batch production but with less materials
options.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Scimitar:</em>  The standard orcish sword and a fine slashing weapon, larger than a dwarvish short sword but still wieldable in one hand by any orc.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Large Dagger:</em> An inferior blade, but can occassionally inflict deadly deep stab wounds. 
A common choice to issue to Raiding crews since it takes a minimum amount of 
metal to craft.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Club:</em> An orcish blunt weapon; with its large contact 
surface it is a crude weapon compared to Dwarven hammers, but still serviceable 
in the hands of a strong orc.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Jagged Axe:</em>  This axe lacks the critical strikes of the Dwarven battleaxe, 
but has extra contact area. Strong or skilled Orcish Axeman may prefer the reliable stopping 
and hewing power against any humanoid sized targets.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Toothed Spear:</em>  A good all-around weapon, wielders will alternate piercing impaling blows with raking slashes; and even smaller orcs can effectly pair it with a shield.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bladed Chains:</em>  A two-handed flail weapon, which inflicts painful piercing damage.  Great for disabling foes, not the best for finishing them off quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tomahawk:</em>  A small axe, which can be wielded in combination with throwing tomahawks (ammo) and a shield.  Popular with orc frontier patrols in small garrisons that lack a dedicated archery squad.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ammo:</em> The basic orcish ammo are bodkin arrows (for bows), Throwing tomahawks (for tomahawks), and darts (for blowguns and flachette guns). The Orcish Fletcher can make more powerful, enchanted arrows given the right tools. Orcs do not commonly use a crossbow.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Great-weapons:</em> Orcs can produce the Great Axe and Maul, identical to the
dwarven versions, but many Uruks are large enough to wield these weapons
one-handed!</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Ranged Weapons</h2>

<h3>Bowyer</h3>

<p>Here you can make the entry-level Orcish "Recurve Bow," which is a
fine weapon. The Bowyer can also make wood or bone tomahawks, which are
very poor melee weapons, but they would at least allow you to quickly start
equipping throwing tomahawks.  A tomahawk squad which will ever see action in a
close melee should switch to forged or damascene metal tomahawks as soon as
possible.</p>

<h3>Orcish Fletcher</h3>

<p>Many Orc clans rely heavily on archers to hunt, and to provide ranged support
for the warbands.  The Fletcher makes "Composite bows," requiring lamellar
leather as well as wood, or bone or iron.  These bows are twice as powerful as
the orcish recurve bow, that is, four times the primitive Dwarvish bow, so it
is worth upgrading when possible. The fletcher can also make batches of arrows
from lots of common materials, freeing up your forges for other work.  With
access to Elven toolkits, the Fletcher can even make devastating enchanted
arrows.</p>

<h3>Guns</h3>

<p>Smaller Orcish settlements, if they need firearms, typically turn 
to the local Freelancer's Guild for a few sets of corsairs arms (a pistol
paired with a large dagger), although the price that 
pirates charge for ammo adds up quickly. Alternatively, a Goblin 
Tinkerer's Shanty can produce a mechanical dart-throwing Flachette gun that 
serves nearly as well. The Tinkerer may work closely with the Kobolds too, 
who can create vast quantities of darts and poison. Larger camps with 
access to proper raw materials such as potash, gypsum, brass, and lead may 
choose to establish proper pistol and ammo production domestically. With 
access to Human toolkits, the Tinkerer can make muskets too.</p>

<h2>Tribal Warcrafter</h2>

<p>The Tribal Warcrafter deals in Ironbone and Bloodsteel, weapons 
made directly from bone, ash, lamellar leather, and blood. He can also 
make a few items from rock and obsidian.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Macuahuitl</em>: This tribal weapon deals some longsword-like slashes and some shallow but very long raking cuts, can be devastating to lightly armored opponents.  </p></li>
<li><p>War Claws: Savage daggers fixed to the warrior's fists, these weapons 
deal piercing damage that can penetrate armor, and incapacitate the enemy with 
pain.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bola throwers and ammo:</em> The bola is an incapacitating thrown weapon preferred by 
some Orcish hunters.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Jagged Spears</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Damasc Forge</h2>

<p>The Damasc Forge makes a small selection unique weapons from advanced alloys, 
using metal-folding techniques handed down by the clan artisans.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Katana</em>: The katana is a medium size slashing sword with small contact area, like a shortsword, but 
with deeper strike penetration depth.  The patternwelded mithril version crafted by the Damascene folder should slice almost any armor.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Daikatana</em>:  The daikatana is a large slashing sword, with deeper strike penetration than a longsword.  The Orcish daikatana would be impractically large for dwarves (or snaga) but Uruks can handle it even with a shield.  A skilled Orcish warrior can cut down even large, armored targets with a few strikes from a well-crafted mithril daikatana.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Polehammer</em>:  This unique weapon is a blunt weapon wielded with the spear skill.  Sometimes it will strike with a frightening amount of force due to a small contact area and leverage from a long haft.  The patternwelded wolfram version crafted by the damascene folder is as deadly as any dwarven hammer, although it requires two hands for almost all users.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tomahawks</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Warrior Society Weapons</h2>

<p>Warrior Society Weapons represent dual-wield loadouts, and act 
either as particularly powerful melee weapons, or as good melee weapons with a 
strong ranged attack. The material of the PRIMARY weapon determines the 
material of the Society kit. If you need extra SECONDARY weapons to 
complete your kits, the material isn't critical, so consider buying them from 
the Caravanserai or Freelancers guild.</p>

<p>^ Society Weapons are gear kits assembled by warriors, not forged by smiths. 
The "^" skill is the one that determines the weapon quality.
* 60000: Most orcs (possibly not snaga and dreamwalkers) can wield this item 
with a shield.
<em>* 80000: Uruks can use this item with a shield.
*</em>*: The Corsairs' arms are a simple pairing of pistol and dagger. They do not
require a codex, and can be purchased from the freelancer's guild, or assembled
there from individual components.</p>

<h2>Advanced Workshops</h2>

<p>Blueprints for advanced workshops are obtained by walking the dreams of great
foes.  Experiment with these advanced workshops to unlock rare and powerful
weapons which are otherwise not available to Orcs. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Great Bow: A 2-handed longbow that propels arrows with 
even greater force than a composite bow.</li>
<li>Crystalglass weapons: slightly inferior to steel</li>
<li>Orichalcum weapons can pierce steel, and be inscribed with runes; armor 
provides superior protection against impact and non-penetrating attacks</li>
<li>Deep-bronze weapons can pierce steel and orichalcum; good for blunt weapons 
too; armor provides superior protection against edge attacks</li>
<li>Hand Cannons: a ranged weapon firing cannonballs and grenades</li>
<li>Wraithblades: a magical weapon, strong in melee and capable of firing 'bladeshard' 
ammo</li>
<li>Ivywhip: a magical weapon, strong in melee and capable of firing 'ivy tendril' 
ammo</li>
<li>Bladetanker: a industrial weapon, a mine-cart bristling with orcish blades and 
(potentially) filled with firey molten stone</li>
<li>Melee heavy weapons: Extra large and massive, but about half of the attacks 
will give a special effect</li>
<li>Chainaxe: Bonus wound surface area and velocity; 2-handed 
for small orcs and all snaga</li>
<li>Vibroblade: Bonus penetration depth; 2-handed for small 
snaga</li>
<li>Steamhammer: Bonus velocity; 2-handed for small uruks and 
most orcs, unwieldable by snaga</li>
<li>Clockwork crossbows: a very powerful and rapid bolt-throwing weapon</li>
</ul>
