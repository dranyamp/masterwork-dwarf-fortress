<h1>Embarks and Scenarios</h1>
<h3>Vale of Tears</h3>

<p>His name was once legend among your clan - Aguur'thashum, the Black Arrow. He
came up through the ranks as a line grunt in a resistance warband protecting
the last of the Orcish Druids' Places of Power. When the deep forests were
finally lost to the elves, he lead a battered and rag-tag group in a desperate
battle for survival, leaving only ash in their wake.  Ultimately, he found
himself hunting alone in the darkest corners of the elder kingdoms, striking at
Elven princelings with single arrows fletched with ravens' plumes. Now the
Black Arrow is a shadow of his former self, blind with age and crippled with
old scars, and forgotten by many of the young warchiefs vying for favor. He has
cashed in all his remaining favors with the Clan Council to outfit one final
expedition and counts on you to see it through. The time for subtlety, for
knives in the dark, has passed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Goals: Embark with the "Forest Clan" profile in a region with both Elves and</li>
<li><p>Elven Bandits. Initiate war with both.  Build a camp
with at least 3 Elven Labor Cells and 1 Goblin Sawmill. Build an above ground
temple exclusively from wood and embellished with mithril, large enough for a
Stone Circle and 3 totem poles, and housing. House in the temple at least 3
Druids, plus their assistant Dreamwalkers and any other worthy acolytes you see
fit.</p></li>
<li><p>Tips: Use the Raiders Drydock to get Elven laborers and Goblin migrants. A
Druidic codex can be either crafted or obtained on a raid; then use it at the
Stone Circle to enlighten your Dreamwalkers. </p></li>
<li><p>Bonus 1: Burn, melt, butcher, or destroy any items looted from elvish
invaders or stolen from traders (using Raiders' plunder is fair
game). </p></li>
<li><p>Bonus 2: Capture a Treesinger's Pagoda and ensnare
the ancient spirits of the forest to give fairwood and mithril as tribute for
the temple.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Old Ways</h3>

<p>When the enemy marched on the Great Clanholding, your kin held
the pass at Bitter Narrows for hours. The entire council of elders
escaped, and you held the ford. The other supposed "warlords" escaped, and
still your folk alone held the ford. In the end your father sent you away
with an oath to safeguard the clan in his stead. He fell fighting back to
back with his brothers, after exacting a terrible toll from the human vanguard.
A near escape and a long bitter winter followed, but of course, you endured.
Yesterday, a clan liaison arrived to announce that due to your greatly
diminished numbers, your clan-holding was being dissolved. Your kin are to
disperse into the towns. You are to report for training as a shieldbearer
second-class in support of a new professional pike-and-musket battalion, modeled
after some human tactical nonsense. Today, the liaison woke up at sunrise,
confused and alone in his fine silken tent. You, your tribe, and your
herds were visible only as a cloud of dust on the horizon.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Goals: Embark with the "Steppe Clan" profile.
Equip at least 15 soldiers with gear from the traditional Jaguar, Falcon, or
Dragon Warrior Societies. Record 50 or more kills of Human or Dwarven
troops in melee or with ranged attacks from Society wargear. All snaga-caste
orcs must live in a separate complex and are forbidden from melee combat,
crafting, and metalworking. </p></li>
<li><p>Tips: Use the Tribal wargear, Fletcher, Damasc shop,
and/or Forge to craft traditional weapons, and combine them into Society Wargear
at the meadhall. </p></li>
<li><p>Bonus 1: Embark on an aquifer (you may adjust the
embark to bring stone)</p></li>
<li><p>Bonus 2: Since you are estranged from the central
Clan Council, set the population cap to 80 or less.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Thunderguard</h3>

<p>Your clan traces its lineage back to the Orcish Sorcerer-kings
of the deep. When you were young, your great-uncle would unlock the old
stockpiles to show you the mechanized crossbows, the automata, the black powder
and strange runic weapons. But your uncle was no sorcerer, nor even a
mechanist, and the ancient weapons were rusted and decrepit after long decades
of neglect. In any case the stockpiles were lost to the Drow years ago in
the Underdark wars. Your clan is now diminished almost to a feral pack of
animals, scavenging for scraps in the moonlight, hiding in caves from Human
outriders from dawn to dusk. You agree with your cousin, the chief, on a
desperate mission: you will take a small team of picked Orcs, build a secret
holding deep below the hills, and rebuild a devastating arsenal in relative
safety. Only once you have the strength to finally break your enemies will
you reveal yourself to the surface world again.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Goals: Embark with the "Mountain Clan" profile in a
region without Human Bandit trade partners. Delve directly to the 1st or
2nd cavern; anything built above the 1st cavern must be made of Factory-produced
blocks, metal, or obsidian. Equip at least 20 soldiers with gunpowder
weapons including at least 5 Seawolf or Lifeguard Society arms kits.
Ultimately build an citadel and obelisk on the surface as a beacon for your
scattered clan.</p></li>
<li><p>Tips: Buy ammo at the Freelancers' Guild or craft it
at the Goblin Tinkerer. Gunpowder weapons are available at the Freelancer
or Tinkerer; by raiding Humans and Merchants Guild, or by loot in ordinary
combat.</p></li>
<li><p>Bonus 1: Build an Altar of Storms and train 2 or more
Sorcerers to support the Thunderguard.</p></li>
<li><p>Bonus 2: Capture a Heavy Weapons Armory and destroy
at least 10 enemies with cannons' Grenade ammo or steam-powered melee weapons.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Blood Price</h3>

<p>You are a favored privateer and bounty hunter of the
Shadowbroker. Or, you were, as recently as 12 hours ago. Currently
the Broker's second-best galleon lies broken on the strand, all the treasure in
her hold lost to the depths, with only a drunken posse of goblinoid halfwits
blinking at you for orders. Already you are doing your best to hatch some
schemes - the <em>Trinimac's Revenge</em> will never sail again, so you might as well
start salvaging. You suppose that the Broker can be reasonable,
particularly if he never finds out what actually happened. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Goals: Embark with the "Shipwrecked Longboat"
profile. Build a pirate cove consisting of a waterfront villa, at least 2
raider's drydocks, 2 freelancer's guildhalls, and one of each type of
caravanserai bazaar. Cover your debt by acquiring at least 20,000 platinum
coins, plus an additional 5000 for each elapsed game year.</p></li>
<li><p>Tips: Use the Raider's docks to capture caravanserai
blueprints; use the Common Bazaar and Shadowbroker's Bazaar to combine smaller
currencies to gold and platinum.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bonus 1: As a known pirate, coins with your mark are
practically worthless; you may not mint coins at the forge.</p></li>
<li><p>Bonus 2: Rebuild the Shadowbroker's Galleon, a
fortress suspended above the waves with housing for at least 7, galley, sickbay,
barracks, captain's quarters, and a ballista.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Embark Profiles</h2>

<p>Depending on your Masterwork version, you may or may not have
had some Orcish embark profiles included. You can cut and paste these into
your data/init/embark_profiles.txt file. If you have some successful
or fun embark loadouts please share them on the forums too!</p>
