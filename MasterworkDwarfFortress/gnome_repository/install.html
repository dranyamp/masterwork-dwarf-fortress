        <p>This mod is pre-installed. Just download, unpack, thats it. When you are reading this, you already installed the mod, congratulation. Please do not copy it over vanilla DF or older mod versions. Just unpack it into a new folder.</p>
        <p>To alter the mod, you can run the Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.exe. You will need to do this to set Gnomes as a playable race. Just open it up, click on 'Races' and you will see a large list of civilizations.  Tick the box under 'Playable: Fortress' and all is done.</p>
        <p>If you just want to play one race, it is recommended to turn the other races non-playable. It will make embarking easier, since you dont have to chose your race ingame.</p>

        <p align="center"><strong class="Rot">How to do a bug report</strong></p>
        <p>Sorry, had to add this. When you report bugs, please state the mod version and the tileset you use. If you run the mod on Mac or Linux, please state this as well. I need this kind of info, otherwise I cant search in the right places. =&gt; Link to forum thread.</p>

<p align="center"><strong class="Rot">Getting Started </strong></p>
        <p>Gnomes: Small, but excellent with animals and machines.  If you like to stay out of the way while fending off enemies with animals and traps, the gnomish race will suit you well.  Start out by recruiting allies from the surrounding wildlife, and build your way up to constructing mighty autonomous war machines.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>The Embark Site</strong></p>
		<p>Picking a good embarking site is essential for gnomes.  Much of your military strength will come from the wildlife in the area, so picking a spot with a good selection of large predators will be very useful.  Gnomes are at peace with natural wildlife, so embarking in a savage biome may be worthwhile - but watch out for any supernatural or intelligent roaming monsters!  In addition, many gnomish upgrades require large amounts of metal, so embarking in a spot with good mining is also important.

<p align="center"><strong>The Embark Preparation</strong></p>
        Pretty standard stuff here, but you'll want at least one good animal trainer - it'll make recruiting wildlife much easier.  Mechanics are also useful.  Military skills can probably be ignored, since gnomes won't be winning many direct fights anyway.
